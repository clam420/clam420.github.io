We hope y'all come visit us in person, but if you can't, take a look at this virtual tour.

We live in a historical apartment complex right in the middle of Central Square. Less than a block away from Shaw's as well as the bustling restaurants of Central Square, you'll never want for food in Chi Lambda Mu! Getting to anywhere in Cambridge or Boston is extremely convenient, as we are only a few blocks away from a T stop. 

Kitchen

The kitchen is the center of the social life at Chi Lambda Mu. Here's where we come to eat and catch up on our days with each other. This is where the bonds of sisterhood are made!

Lounge

The lounge is also a hub of socialization. Sisters love to kick back and relax with their favorite video games and board games. The sounds of laughter and sisterhood fill the air as they Grand Tichu and Smash their opponents.

Rooms

Each of our rooms are lovingly cared for. Many of the rooms have murals, a testament to the long standing history of our sorority.

<h3 style="text-align: left">Daniel <b>Bausher-Belton</b></h3>
Bio: A native of the sunshine state originally. Now, however, he lives within the sorority. Daniel is a sophomore. He is currently 6-3. Internally he is referred to as "dbausher". Spends a lot of time being a legend and playing with dragons and phoenii. Nationally ranked procrastinator. Always ready to help! Mail him @dbausher, in case you didnt pick up on that. Ever available and happy to meet new pledges! (IS JOHN CENA)

<h3 style="text-align: left">Lilly <b>Chin</b></h3>
Bio: Hails from the universally acknowledged "Worst. State. Ever", so being in Massachusetts is just a clear improvement. Although it's debatable whether or not she even lives at the sorority itself, she's usually held responsible for starting the impetus to turn Chi Lambda Mu into a social and co-ed sorority. Has a tendency to SPEAK IN ALL CAPS and conduct social shenanigans. In her spare time, she shoots down small clay frisbees with a shotgun. Currently proudly serving as Rush Chair and Social Floor for Chi Lambda Mu!

<h3 style="text-align: left">Eric <b>Lujan</b></h3>
Bio: He can lead a horse to water... and make it serve him a drink. He stares into the abyss... and it winks back. He doesn't just crack the code... he shatters it. He's all that... and a chip factory. He once knocked his own socks off. He knows Victoria's Secret. He is... well, actually a pretty boring Las Vegas-Floor Pi transplant who enjoys making outdated references, but he paid his membership fees so we have to say he's a member of XAM.

<h3 style="text-align: left">Katie <b>Sedlar</b></h3>
Bio: Originally from The Land of Infinite Corn, Katie now lives in a space void that sucks in all light. Katie is an active participant in a collective of assassins, and she enjoys writing training exercises for other assassins, giving the death penalty to those who tap others on the shoulder, and acting as a cog in a giant square machine. Last summer, she worked on a Borg cube near Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, where she learned a lot about getting bundles of wire to do her work for her. Katie joined Chi Lambda Mu in 2014.

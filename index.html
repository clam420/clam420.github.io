  <p>
    Chi Lambda Mu is a co-ed MIT sorority located conveniently in Central Square. Our tight knit community of sisters love to kick back with video games, local exploration, and culinary adventures. We'll hope you'll stop by to visit, but for now, take a look around our website to give you a good sense of what we do.
